## Goalkeeper game
### How it works?
A small game in which the player uses the mouse to control the goalkeeper who is standing in the goal and through which the ball is sent. 
The main task of the game is to repel the ball that is sent through the goal. 
The goalkeeper's successful and unsuccessful saves are provided in the scoreboard.
