## Goalkeeper game
### Idea
A simple game in which the player uses the mouse to control the goalkeeper. The main task of the game is to repel the ball that is sent through the goal. The goalkeeper's successful and unsuccessful saves are displayed in the scoreboard.

### Pop-up messages (Snackbar)
The successful and unsuccessful saves are displayed as a snackbar and an icon pops up from the bottom accordingly.

</p>

### Movement
The user controls the goalkeeper with the mouse, moving the goalie to both right and left directions. Movements to the right and left are "locked". The player stops right at the side poles. A player's hitbox is a rectangle that is slightly larger than the player's model for it to be more simple to collide with the ball.
